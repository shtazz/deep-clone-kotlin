Use `deepCopy` function to create copy of an object.
The usage of utility class restricted by the list of next types:
- primitives;
- strings;
- collections;
- maps;
- data classes, that contain all types listed above, and that could contain reference to itself.

There is a `main()` method with example of usage in `Main` class.

Also, you can find tests in `test` package.

If you find any errors while testing the `deepCopy()` method, please don't hesitate to leave a comment.
